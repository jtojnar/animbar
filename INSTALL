animbar is configured for out of source compilation with cmake 
(www.cmake.org). The only requirement is a recent QT 
(http://qt.nokia.com/) installation. 

To compile and install animbar, get the sources, unpack them and change 
to the root directory of the animbar local tree. There, create a build 
directory,
	
	mkdir build
	
and change to that directory

	cd build
	
Run cmake to setup the build scripts in the build directory

	cmake ../
	
This gives you a Makefile, that lets you compile the source with

	make
	
and finally install with (become root)

	make install
	
For more information, have a look at the cmake homepage www.cmake.org.
